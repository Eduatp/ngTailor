{"name":"ngTailor","tagline":"Scaffold an Angular project with Grunt and Bower configurations fitted to your needs","body":"[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)\r\n\r\n## Why is ngTailor awesome ?\r\n* Interactive way to scaffold your angular project to fit your needs. \r\n  Need angular-i18n locales ? Want angular version 1.2.1 ? You need to lint your CSS ? Just answer a few questions prompted to you.\r\n* Your assets dependencies are managed by [bower](http://www.bower.io)\r\n* Automatically run [ng-min](https://github.com/btford/ngmin) before your minification process\r\n* Do not handle manually one index.html for development and one index.html for production thanks to [grunt-usemin](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin).\r\n  Automatically replace your scripts and stylesheets declaration with the minified version when packaging your app for production.\r\n* Watch for you assets changes and automatically run `jshint` or `csslint` on your code and even unit tests.\r\n* Livereload is out of the box. No F5 anymore\r\n* Automatically output a hash in your assets file name for caching purpose.\r\n* Set up tests to be run with Karma with Jasmine.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n1. Install [node and npm](http://www.nodejs.org)\r\n2. Install **Grunt** running `npm install -g grunt-cli` \r\n3. Install **Bower** running `npm install -g bower`\r\n4. Install **grunt-init** running `npm install -g grunt-init`\r\n5. Install this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory (`%USERPROFILE%\\.grunt-init\\` on Windows) \r\n   by running `git clone https://github.com/lauterry/ngTailor.git ~/.grunt-init/angular`\r\n\r\n## Generate your Angular project\r\n1. Create a new folder for your project\r\n2. Open a terminal and run `grunt-init angular` in your project folder\r\n3. Answer the questions prompted to you to scaffold your project to your needs\r\n4. Run `npm install && bower install && grunt bower-install` to download your projet dependencies\r\n5. Run `grunt server` to serve your static assets at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)\r\n6. Your should see \"Yeahhh ! You're ready !\" displayed in your browser\r\n7. Voil√† ! Your Angular project is ready !\r\n\r\n## Developement\r\n* Run `grunt server` to start a static web server and open your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). \r\n* Livereload will be automatically active meaning that you can see your modification on the browser without hitting F5.\r\n* `jshint` and/or `csslint` will be run on your files when they change.\r\n* If you choose to have unit tests, they will be run as your test and source files change.\r\n\r\n## Package for Production\r\n* Run `grunt` to prepare your static assets for production. \r\n* Your package will be generated in a `dist` folder and your javascripts and stylesheets will be concatenated, minified and versionned.","google":"UA-46551712-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
