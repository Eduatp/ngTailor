## Why is grunt-init-angular awesome ?
* Interactive way to scaffold your angular project to fit your needs. 
  Need angular-i18n locales ? Want angular version 1.2.1 ? You need to lint your CSS ? Just answer a few questions prompted to you.
* You assets dependencies are managed by [bower](http://www.bower.io)
* Automatically run [ng-min](https://github.com/btford/ngmin) before your minification process
* Do not handle manually one index.html for development and one index.html for production thanks to [grunt-usemin](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin).
  Automatically replace your scripts and stylesheets declaration with the minified version when packaging your app for production.
* Watch for you assets changes and automatically run `jshint` or `csslint` on your code and even unit tests.
* Livereload is out of the box. No F5 anymore
* Automatically output a hash in your assets file name for caching purpose.
* Set up tests to be run with Karma with Jasmine.

## Prerequisites
1. Install [node and npm](http://www.nodejs.org)

## Developement
* Run `grunt server` to start a static web server and open your browser at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). 
* Livereload will be automatically active meaning that you can see your modification on the browser without hitting F5.
* `jshint` and/or `csslint` will be run on your files when they change.
* If you choose to have unit tests, they will be run as your test and source files change.

## Package for Production
* Run `grunt` to prepare your static assets for production. 
* Your package will be generated in a `dist` folder and your javascripts and stylesheets will be concatenated, minified and versionned.
